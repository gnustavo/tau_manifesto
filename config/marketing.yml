faq:
  - question: What does a purchase include?
    answer: A purchase of *The Tau Manifesto* includes the full essay in all three common ebook formats (EPUB, MOBI, and PDF), as well as downloadable versions of the Tau Talk, both short (15 min.) and long (1 hr.) versions.

  - question: Why would I want to buy *The Tau Manifesto*?
    answer: All of the materials available are for purchase are also available online for free, but if you buy the manifesto then you own the files in perpetuity. You also get the satisfaction of lending your support to the cause. Finally, over the years I expect I will find various creative ways to support especially ardent tauists; no guarantees, but you can think of the product price as buying you admission to a very exclusive club.
