\title{The Tau Manifesto}

\section{The most important number in mathematics} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_most_important_number_in_mathematics}

Books have been written. I mean, \emph{books!} Some poor dudes memorize dozens, even hundreds or thousands of its digits. What kind of sad sack memorizes fifty digits of $\pi$ (\hyperref[fig:michael_hartl]{Figure~}\ref{fig:michael_hartl})?

As mathematician Bob Palais observed in his delightful article \emph{Pi is Wrong!}, $\pi$ is wrong. As he argued, and as this manifesto will thoroughly prove, the correct number is actually $2\pi$. But even the plucky Professor Palais couldn't quite bring himself to take the idea fully seriously, instead introducing a weird three-legged symbol for $2\pi$ (Fig), which he called ``one turn''. As we'll see, the description is prescient, but the symbol, lamentably, is D.O.A. 

The $\tau$ manifesto is dedicated to the proposition that when someone says ``$\pi$ is wrong'', the proper response is ``No, \emph{really}.'' And the correct number, tragically known as $2\pi$, deserves a proper name. The $\tau$ manifesto proposes that this name---as I hope you will not be surprised to learn---should be~$\tau$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\tau$ has no serious conflicts with current usage.\footnote{In programming terms, there are no serious namespace clashes.} The symbol~$\tau$ is used for, e.g., \emph{strain} in mechanical engineering and \emph{proper time} in special and general relativity, but there is no common conflicting usage.\footnote{Minor clashes are OK; after all, physicists manage to use $e$ both for the natural number and for the charge on an electron without causing apparent harm.}
  
  \item $\tau$ is typographically similar to $\pi$, thereby evoking the proper image of a circle constant. (Unfortunately, the number of ``legs'' isn't quite right: it would be poetic if we could write $\pi = 2\tau$, but it wasn't meant to be.)
  
  \item As we shall see momentarily, $\tau$ represents one \emph{turn} of a circle. The English word ``turn'' comes from the Greek word for ``lathe'': \emph{tornos}. Or, as the Greeks would put it: 
  
\[ \tau o\rho\nu o\varsigma \]
  
\end{enumerate}

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say: \emph{Q.E.D., bitches!}

\section{The nature of the circle} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_nature_of_the_circle}

Long considered the perfect geometric form, the circle is defined as the only shape with constant diameter. Wait---no, it's not. There are infinitely many shapes with constant diameter (Fig). A circle is defined as the set of all points equidistant from a given point. That point is the \emph{center} of the circle, and the distance is the \emph{radius}. There is not a diameter to be

\[ e^{i\tau} = 1 \]


This is $\tau$. It is the true circle constant. After seeing how awesome $\tau$ is, $\pi$ will seem lame and old-fashioned.\footnote{\emph{Pi is Wrong!} by Bob Palais.}

\section{Puns}

We come now to the final objection: ``What about puns?'', I hear you cry. I know, I know, ``$\pi$ in the sky'' is so very clever. And yet, $\tau$ offers its own pregnant possibilities. After all, once you have accepted $\tau$ism, you will become a $\tau$ist like me. It is not that $\tau$ is a piece of $\pi$, but $\pi$ that is a piece of $\tau$---one-half~$\tau$, to be exact. This is the true nature of the~$\tau$.
